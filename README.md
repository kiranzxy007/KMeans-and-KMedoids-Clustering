# MACHINE-LEARNING

Problem Statement:
● The assignment targets to implement K-Means and K-Medoid algorithms to
cluster the dataset consists of socio-economic and health factors of countries
and determine the overall development of the country
Implementation:
● Implement K-Means and K-Medoid algorithms to cluster the given dataset as
follows:
○ Perform standard data cleaning operations such as data cleaning
(handling missing values) and data scaling (handling the outliers)
○ Classify the countries according to the following categories:
■ Developed Country
■ Developing Country
■ Under-Developing Country
